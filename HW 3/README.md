## Problem 2

(a) train CNN (make sure to apply dataset normalization and dropout)
- [ ] (i) adam optimizer
- [ ] (ii) SGD with nesterov momentum

(b) choose best model from (a).
then apply
- [ ] xavier initialization
- [ ] data augmentation
- [ ] batch normalization
- [ ] learning rate scheduler
- [ ] tune dropout: ```0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8```

(c) choose best model from (b).
then

- [ ] (i) display training and validation losses and accuracies
- [ ] (ii) show four randomly augmented images from each class
- [ ] (iii) visualize activations of conv layer channels for two images
- [ ] (iv) visualize learned conv filters
