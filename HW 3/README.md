## Problem 2

(a) train CNN

    (i) adam optimizer
    (ii) SGD with nesterov momentum

(b) choose best model from (a).
apply
    
    xavier initialization
    data augmentation
    dropout
    learning rate scheduler

(c) choose best model from (b).

    (i) display training and validation losses and accuracies
    (ii) show four randomly augmented images from each class
    (iii) visualize activations of conv layer channels for two images
    (iv) visualize learned conv filters
