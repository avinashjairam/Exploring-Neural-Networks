# Final Project

- [x] code language model using LSTM
- [x] tune hyperparams (emb size, dropout)
- [ ] plot train and val curves (both loss and ppl)
- [ ] plot for hyperparams (multi-bar plot)

- [ ] print test loss and ppl using best hyperparam model

- [ ] generate sequences using best hyperparam model

- [ ] analyze embeddings
  - [ ] nearest 10 words and furthest 10 words
  - [ ] UMAP
  - [ ] visualize all words (not sure how it will look)
  - [ ] visualize hand picked words
