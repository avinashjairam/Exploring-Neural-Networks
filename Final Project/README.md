# Final Project

- [x] code language model using LSTM
- [x] tune hyperparams (emb size, dropout)
- [x] plot train and val curves (both loss and ppl)
- [x] plot for hyperparams (multi-bar plot)

- [x] print test loss and ppl using best hyperparam model

- [x] generate sequences using best hyperparam model

- [x] analyze embeddings
  - [x] nearest 10 words and furthest 10 words
  - [trying..] UMAP
  - [x] visualize 500 words
  - [x] visualize hand picked words
